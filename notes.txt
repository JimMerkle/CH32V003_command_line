SYSTICK Timer (System Timer) See Reference Manual, section 6.5.4 "STK register description"
By default, STK->CTLK, STCLK bit, Bit2, is cleared at reset, setting the SYSTICK input clock to HCLK/8 for time base.

Delay_Us() and Delay_Ms() work as follows:
1) Clear CNTIF flag in STK->SR, bit0
2) Load compare register, STK->CMPLR, with number of SYSTICK counts to delay (HCLK/8)
3) Clear SYSTICK counter, STK->CNTL = 0
4) Start SYSTICK counter by setting STE, bit0 in CTLR
5) Wait for CNTIF flag to become set in the STK->SR
6) Stop SYSTICK counter by clearing STE, bit0 in CTLR
